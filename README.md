# SECRET-SHARK
Search for confidential information via GREP and FIND command, by exposing the output in JSON

## Run (Linux only)

```sh
$ python3 /folder/you/want/to/scan
```

### TODOs

 - Write MORE Tests
 - Extract Regex into separate file
 - Build Logic in Python and leave GREP as SysCall (try mmap)
 - In case of Git folder scan only the latest 3 chains of Git
